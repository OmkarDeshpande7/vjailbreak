FIELDS:
  apiVersion	<string>
    API version of the referent.

  fieldPath	<string>
    If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this
    string
    should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as
    desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
    For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this
    would take on a value like:
    "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container
    that triggered
    the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
    (container with
    index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined
    way of
    referencing a part of an object.
